## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local development environment:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ferajofficial/your_tracks_riverpod
    cd your-tracks
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Set up Firebase**

    Follow the instructions in the [Firebase Setup](#firebase-setup) section to configure Firebase for the project.

4. **Run the application**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

### Firebase Setup

1. **Create a Firebase project**

    Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. **Add Project to the Firebase Using Firebase CLI**

    - Follow the CLI Guidelines [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) to Setup the project for your prefereable platforms.


3. **Enable Firestore**

    In the Firebase Console, enable Firestore in the Database section.


### Riverpod Integration

Your Tracks uses Riverpod for state management. Here's a brief overview of how Riverpod is integrated into the project:

1. **Add Riverpod to dependencies**

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      flutter_riverpod: ^1.0.0
      ...
    ```

2. **Create Providers**

    Define providers for managing state. Example:

    ```dart
    final trackProvider = StateNotifierProvider<TrackNotifier, List<Track>>((ref) {
      return TrackNotifier();
    });
    ```

3. **Use Providers in Widgets**

    Use the `Consumer` widget to listen to providers and update UI accordingly.

    ```dart
    class TrackList extends ConsumerWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
        final tracks = watch(trackProvider);

        return ListView.builder(
          itemCount: tracks.length,
          itemBuilder: (context, index) {
            return ListTile(
              title: Text(tracks[index].name),
              ...
            );
          },
        );
      }
    }
    ```
